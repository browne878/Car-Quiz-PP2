You can see the live website [here]().

The purpose of this website to provide the user with a fun and challenging game to test their knowledge of cars.

My aim for this quiz was to make a simple and easy to use UI that allows the user to focus on the game. I wanted to be able to randomise the questions so the user can play multiple times. Finally, I wanted this website to be responsive, so that users on all devices can enjoy the completed website.
