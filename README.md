You can see the live website [here](https://browne878.github.io/Car-Quiz-PP2/).

The purpose of this website to provide the user with a fun and challenging game to test their knowledge of cars.

My aim for this quiz was to make a simple and easy to use UI that allows the user to focus on the game. I wanted to be able to randomise the questions so the user can play multiple times. Finally, I wanted this website to be responsive, so that users on all devices can enjoy the completed website.

In order to Fork the Repository, please follow the instructions below.
 1. Navigage to [this](https://github.com/browne878/Car-Quiz-PP2) repository.
 2. Next, in the top left of the page, click the fork button.
 3. If you are a member of a team, you may need to choose where to Fork the repository too.

Once you have forked the Repository, you can then clone it to your local machine. To do so, please follow the instructions below.
 1. Navigate to your Forked repository.
 2. Click the green Code button above the repositories files.
 3. Copy the URL in the dropdown window.

You have now forked and cloned the repository.

### Local Deployment

These instructions will tell you how to deploy the repository on your local machine with VSCode and the extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). Please ensure you have VSCode and the Live Server extension installed before beginning the following steps.

1. First, follow the steps for Cloning and Forking the repository so you have the repository locally.
2. Open the folder with VSCode by doing one of the following:
    - Right click the file and click `Open with Code`
    - Open command prompt, navigate inside the directiory and run the command `code .`
    - Open VSCode, click file, open folder and then navigate to the repository folder and open it.
3. Next, at the very bottom of the window, there will be a button that says `Go Live`. Click this button and it will deploy it locally and open it in your default browser for you to view.

### Remote Deployment

I deployed this website using GitHub Pages. The steps I took to do this are as follows.

1. Start by navigating to the GitHub repository.
2. Next, towards the top of the page, navigate to the `Settings` tab.
3. After this, on the menu of the left of the page, click on the `Pages` tab.
4. Now, click the `Branch` dropdown menu and select `Main` or whatever the name of your main branch is.
5. Finally, wait for the site to be published. This can take a few moments. The link will be shown at the top of the page.
